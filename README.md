# 🎮 RetSOL Browser Emulator
**The Ultimate GBA Experience for Play Solana (PSG1)**

RetSOL is a lightweight, web-based Game Boy Advance emulator designed specifically for handheld gaming devices. It follows a "Privacy-First" model: **Zero ROMs are hosted here.** Instead, it uses the modern File System Access API to read games and write saves directly to your device's SD card.
