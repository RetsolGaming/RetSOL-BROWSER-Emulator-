# 🎮 RetSOL GBA v12.0 - BETA

The definitive Game Boy Advance injector for the Play Solana (PSG1). This version uses the **Verbatim V3 Logic** to ensure file picking and button responses work 100% on handheld hardware.

## ✨ Updates in v12.0
* **Stable Injection**: Uses the in-memory input trigger to bypass browser security blocks.
* **CRT Mode**: Integrated scanline overlay for that retro feel.
* **Low Memory Engine**: Powered by `gbajs2` for improved performance over the original library.
* **Quick Load Fix**: Re-mapped to provide instant file-access mirroring the main load button.

## 🕹️ Controls
1. **Load Game**: Click the Primary Green button to pick your `.gba` file.
2. **CRT Toggle**: Use the Pink button to turn scanlines On/Off.
3. **Save/Load**: Save your state directly to your browser's local storage (no file download needed).
4. **Controller**: Automatically detects PSG1 physical buttons once a game is running.
